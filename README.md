# Godot Kids Can Learn Practice

Here I will try out different tutorials from [Kids Can Code](https://kidscancode.org/) website.

If the tutorial can be placed in a single scene then the name of the name of the scene will be the main scene for the tutorial otherwise each of the tutorials should have a folder and in that folder there should be a main scene that'll be the entry point.
